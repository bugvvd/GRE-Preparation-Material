## Set2

*Was Felix Mendelssohn (1809—1847) a great composer? On its face, the question seems absurd. One of the most gifted prodigies in the history of music, he produced his first masterpiece at sixteen. From then on, he was recognized as an artist of preternatural abilities, not only as a composer but also as a pianist and conductor. But Mendelssohn’s enduring popularity has often been at odds — sometimes quite sharply — with his critical standing. Despite general acknowledgment of his genius, there has been a noticeable reluctance to rank him with, say, Schumann or Brahms. As Haggin put it, Mendelssohn, as a composer, was a “minor master … working on a small scale of emotion and texture.”*

**Ques2**

Select a sentence in the passage whose function is to indicate the range of Mendelssohn’s musical talents.

> 描述他的能力的只有 “not only as a composer but also as a pianist and conductor”一句。

## **Set4**

*The evolution of intelligence among early large mammals of the grasslands was due in great measure to the line 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 interaction between two ecologically synchronized groups of these animals, the hunting carnivores and the herbivores that they hunted. The interaction resulting from the differences between predator and prey led to a general improvement in brain functions; however, certain components of intelligence were improved far more than others. The kind of intelligence favored by the interplay of increasingly smarter catchers and increasingly keener escapers is defined by attention — that aspect of mind carrying consciousness forward from one moment to the next. It ranges from a passive, free-floating awareness to a highly focused, active fixation. The range through these states is mediated by the arousal system, a network of tracts converging from sensory systems to integrating centers in the brain stem. From the more relaxed to the more vigorous levels, sensitivity to novelty is increased. The organism is more awake, more vigilant; this increased vigilance results in the apprehension of ever more subtle signals as the organism becomes more sensitive to its surroundings. The processes of arousal and concentration give attention its direction. Arousal is at first general, with a flooding of impulses in the brain stem; then gradually the activation is channeled. Thus begins concentration, the holding of consistent images. One meaning of intelligence is the way in which these images and other alertly searched information are used in the context of previous experience. Consciousness links past attention to the present and permits the integration of details with perceived ends and purposes. The elements of intelligence and consciousness come together marvelously to produce different styles in predator and prey. Herbivores and carnivores develop different kinds of attention related to escaping or chasing. Although in both kinds of animal, arousal stimulates the production of adrenaline and norepinephrine by the adrenal glands, the effect in herbivores is primarily fear, whereas in carnivores the effect is primarily aggression. For both, arousal attunes the animal to what is ahead. Perhaps it does not experience forethought as we know it, but the animal does experience something like it. The predator is searchingly aggressive, inner-directed, tuned by the nervous system and the adrenal hormones, but aware in a sense closer to human consciousness than, say, a hungry lizard’s instinctive snap at a passing beetle. Using past events as a framework, the large mammal predator is working out a relationship between movement and food, sensitive to possibilities in cold trails and distant sounds — and yesterday’s unforgotten lessons. The herbivore prey is of a different mind. Its mood of wariness rather than searching and its attitude of general expectancy instead of anticipating are silk-thin veils of tranquillity over an explosive endocrine system*

**Ques7** 
It can be inferred from the passage that in animals less intelligent than the mammals discussed in the passage 

A past experience is less helpful in ensuring survival 
B attention is more highly focused 
C muscular coordination is less highly developed 
D there is less need for competition among species 
E environment is more important in establishing the proper ratio of prey to predator

Ques 18

*The condition of scholarship devoted to the history of women in photography is confounding. Recent years have witnessed the posthumous inflation of the role of the hobbyist Alice Austen into that of a pioneering documentarian while dozens of notable senior figures — Marion Palfi, whose photographs of civil-rights activities in the South served as early evidence of the need for protective legislation, to name one — received scant attention from scholars. And, while Naomi Rosenblum’s synoptic History of Women Photographers covers the subject through 1920 in a generally useful fashion, once she reaches the 1920s, when the venues, forms, applications, and movements of the medium expanded exponentially, she resorts to an increasingly terse listing of unfamiliar names, with approaches and careers summarized in a sentence or two.*



The author of the passage cites Rosenblum’s book most likely in order to 
A suggest that the works documented most thoroughly by historians of women in photography often do not warrant that attention 
B offer an explanation for the observation that not all aspects of the history of women in photography have received the same level of attention 
C provide an example of a way in which scholarship on the history of women in photography has been unsatisfactory 
D suggest that employing a strictly chronological approach when studying the history of women in photography may be unproductive 
E provide support for the notion that certain personalities in women’s photography have attained undue prominence

> 文章主题是 unsatisfactory condition of scholarship，而 R的书就是这样一个例子，所以是C



Ques 19

Which of the following statements about Marion Palfi is supported by the passage?

A Marion Palfi’s photographs would have received greater recognition from historians had her work been done in an era when most aspects of photography were static rather than in a state of transition. 
B Alice Austen has achieved greater notoriety than has Marion Palfi primarily because the subjects that Austen photographed were more familiar to her contemporaries. 
C In addition to providing a record of certain historical events, Marion Palfi’s photographs played a role in subsequent events.

> A不对：文章没提 B不对，文章没提 C对

Ques 20

In the context in which it appears, “inflation” (line 2) most nearly means 
A exaggeration 
B acquisition 
C evaluation 
D distortion 
E attenuation

> hobbyist说明不专业，但是却被捧成了 pioneering documentarian，所以是A

Ques 21

The plan, which the engineers said would save the aquifer by reducing pumping to levels, has passed a governmental environmental review but faces opposition from outdoor and environmental groups. A innocuous

## Section 4

*Sparva, unlike Treland’s other provinces, requires automobile insurers to pay for any medical treatment sought by someone who has been involved in an accident; in the other provinces, insurers pay for nonemergency treatment only if they preapprove the treatment. Clearly, Sparva’s less restrictive policy must be the explanation for the fact that altogether insurers there pay for far more treatments after accidents than insurers in other provinces, even though Sparva does not have the largest population.*

Ques 7

Which of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument? 
A Car insurance costs more in Sparva than in any other province. 
B The cost of medical care in Sparva is higher than the national average. 
C Different insurance companies have different standards for determining what constitutes emergency treatment. 
D Fewer insurance companies operate in Sparva than in any other province. 
E There are fewer traffic accidents annually in Sparva than in any of the provinces of comparable or greater population.

> 选项 A 和 D 各自呈现的后果可能是Sparva的保险公司不得不支付更多医疗费用的结果。但这两者都与保险公司必须支付更多治疗费用的原因无关。 选项 B 不仅不会强化论证，而且可能会削弱论证。 较高的医疗费用为人们寻求保险付款以支付他们接受的任何事故后护理提供了额外的动力。 因此，选择 B 可能会通过为保险公司支付Sparva更多医疗费用提供另一种解释来削弱这一论点。 文中表示，在其他省份，是否属于紧急救治是判断保险公司责任的重要标准。 但由于这一标准不适用于Sparva，因此选项 C 与本文试图建立的观点没有直接关系。

> 所以E

Ques 8

Which of the following statements about Voltaire’s Elements of the Philosophy of Newton can be inferred from the passage? 
A Voltaire’s literary stature helped secure a large audience for this attempt to popularize Newton’s ideas. 
B Voltaire’s status as a nonscientist was an advantage in this effort to bring Newtonian science to the attention of the general public. 
C The frontispiece of the book implies that Voltaire’s understanding of Newton’s ideas was not achieved without assistance.

> A正确；literary giant 就算这个意思
>
> B正确；原文"amateurism in science demonstrated that nonspecialists could also understand Newton’s ideas."
>
> C正确；原文“she serves as the intermediary between Newton and Voltaire, conveying Newton’s ideas to Voltaire.”
